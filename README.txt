This plugin imports RSS content from the Keeping Current Matters Blog.

== Description ==

Personalized Posts™ lets you share a fully-branded version of the daily posts from our KCM Blog. This feature is all about helping you stand out as the market expert. This WordPress plugin automatically imports your Personalized Posts into your own WordPress website, allowing you to share our posts and use all the tools at your disposal in WordPress to customize them further.

== Installation ==

1.Click the Download Plugin button to download the plugin .zip file to your computer.
2. Go to the plugins page in your WordPress site dashboard.
3. Click the “Add New” button.
4. Click “Upload Plugin” then choose and install the file you downloaded in step 1.
5. Click “Activate Plugin” to complete the plugin install.
6. Go to the Settings page for the plugin. Enter your KCM Member ID (everything after “a=” in your Personalized Posts RSS Link) and select the post category on your site into which you would like KCM posts to be imported.
7. Click “Save Changes” to finish setup.

Once you have saved your settings, all current posts in the KCM RSS feed will be imported into your site as WordPress posts. New posts will continue to be added on a daily basis as they appear in the KCM feed.

Once imported, these posts are controlled on your site by your WordPress settings. You can edit, delete, re categorize them, or do anything else you can do through your WordPress dashboard. Display options are controlled by your site, so the posts may not appear exactly as they do on the KCM site.

New daily posts will continue to be downloaded to your site as long as the plugin is active. To stop downloading new posts, deactivate the plugin. If you deactivate the plugin, any existing posts on your site will not be deleted. You may reactivate the plugin to resume the import of new posts at any time.
